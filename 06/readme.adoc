== How to run

The server is written in Rust and can be run using `cargo run`.
Port to listen on can be specified in `src/main.rs`, in the `main` function.

Requests for testing purposes are in the `requests.http` file which can be run using `httpyac --all requests.http`
(potentially also some IDEs, but not completely sure about syntax compatibility).
Port to send requests to can be adjusted in the prologue.

When executing through `httpyac`, id from the response when creating a booking is being read and following requests are formed accordingly.
There are also asserts set up, which mark the request as failed in case some part of the response is not as expected (last line of output summarizes number of successful and failed requests).
