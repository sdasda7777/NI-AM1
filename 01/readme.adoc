== How to run

The server is written in Rust and can be run using `cargo run`.
Port to listen on can be specified in `src/main.rs`, in the `main` function.

Requests for testing purposes are in the `requests.http` file which can be run using `httpyac --all requests.http`
(potentially also some IDEs, but not completely sure about syntax compatibility).
Port to send requests to can be adjusted in the variable `port` in the prologue.
